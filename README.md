# Build & Development

You will need node setup on your machine.

Then you can run the commands below in order to start the client:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

That will build the game and start a client at http://localhost:8080/. The server has hot reload, so every time you
update the code, it should rebuild the client and refresh the tab in your preferred web browser.
